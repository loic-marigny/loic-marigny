I'm a student in last year of **engineering school** at [ESILV](https://esilv.fr/). I work as a junior consultant at [Enedis](https://www.enedis.fr/) as well, and I'm currently on an abroad semester in *Riga, Latvia*.
I'm passionate about **literature, politics and learning other languages.** I'd like to become a developer, you can find my projects and my progress here.
I code in **Python, C#, TypeScript** and I'm trying to get better with web development tools !

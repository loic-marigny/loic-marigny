I'm a student in last year of engineering school. I'm passionate about literature, politics and learning other languages. I'd like to become a developer, you can find my projects and my progress here.
I code in Python, C#, TypeScript and I'm trying to get better with web development tools !
You can reach me on LinkedIn : LoÃ¯c Marigny, or on my other socials linked to my profile.
